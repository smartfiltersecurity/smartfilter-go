# SmartFilter Go bindings

## SmartFilter?

The SmartFilter REST API is the easiest way for individuals and organizations to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks in their web applications. The API has been designed to provide simple access to the powerful content analysis systems and intelligence tools that Prevoty has developed.

## Go bindings

Prevoty has developed a Go library to use SmartFilter quickly and easily. 

## Get Started

To get started:

1) Install the library `go get github.com/prevoty/smartfilter-go/client`

2) Pull a copy or .zip/.tar of the `examples` directory

3) Edit `example.go` - you will want to put in your API key and rule key

4) Run `go run example.go`
